Intravenous (IV) therapy is an important part of clinical care. It can be used to restore fluids, administer blood products or medications, or serve as an alternate route for nutrition when the gastrointestinal tract is not functioning adequately. IV therapy is a common intervention in nursing practice and useful for rapidly addressing symptoms and restoring hemostasis. Although initiating IV therapy is a common nursing intervention, it is an invasive skill and requires diligent safety practices to prevent and address complications.

## 1.2. BASIC CONCEPTS OF VENIPUNCTURE AND INTRAVENOUS THERAPY

Nurses access clients’ veins to collect blood (i.e., perform phlebotomy) and to administer intravenous (IV) therapy. This section will describe several methods for collecting blood, as well as review the basic concepts of IV therapy.

### Blood Collection

Nurses collect blood samples from clients using several methods, including venipuncture, capillary blood sampling, and blood draws from venous access devices. Blood may also be drawn from arteries by specially trained professionals for certain laboratory testing.

#### Venipuncture

**Venipuncture** involves the process of introducing a needle into a client’s vein to collect a blood sample or insert an IV catheter. See [Figure 1.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.1/?report=objectonly)\[[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for an image of venipuncture. Blood sampling with venipuncture may be initiated by a nurse, phlebotomist, or other trained personnel. Venipuncture for collection of a blood sample is an important part of data collection to assess a client’s health status. It is commonly performed to examine hematologic and immune issues such as the body’s oxygen carrying capacity, infection, and clotting function. It is also useful for assessing metabolic and nutrition issues such as electrolyte status and kidney functioning.

[![Figure 1.1 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/bin/ch1therapy-Image005.gif)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.1/?report=objectonly "Figure 1.1 ")

Blood collection is commonly performed via venipuncture from veins in the arms or hands. The most common sites for venipuncture are the large veins located on the antecubital fossa (i.e., the inner side of the elbow). These veins are often preferred for venipuncture because their larger size increases their ability to withstand repetitive blood sampling. However, these veins are not preferred for intravenous therapy due to the mechanical obstruction that can occur in the IV catheter when the elbow joint is contracted.

To perform the skill of venipuncture, the nurse performs many similar steps that occur with IV cannulation. The process of venipuncture for blood sample collection is outlined in the “[Perform Venipuncture Blood Draw](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingadvancedskills/wp-admin/post.php?post=63&action=edit)” checklist later in this chapter.

#### Blood Samples From Central Venous Access Devices

Blood may also be collected by nurses from a client’s existing **central venous access device (CVAD)**. A CVAD is a type of vascular access that involves the insertion of a catheter into a large vein in the arm, neck, chest, or groin.\[[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] CVADs are discussed in more detail in the “[Manage Central Lines](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingadvancedskills/chapter/4-1-introduction/)” chapter that also contains the “[Obtain a Blood Sample From a CVAD](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingadvancedskills/chapter/4-5-checklist-obtain-a-blood-sample-from-a-cvad/)” checklist.

#### Capillary Blood Sampling

Nurses also collect small amounts of blood for testing via capillary blood sampling. **Capillary blood testing** occurs when blood is collected from capillaries located near the surface of the skin. Capillaries in the fingers are used for testing in adults whereas capillaries in the heels are used for infants. An example of capillary blood testing is bedside glucose testing. See [Figure 1.2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.2/?report=objectonly)\[[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for an image of capillary blood glucose testing.

[![Figure 1.2 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/bin/ch1therapy-Image006.gif)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.2/?report=objectonly "Figure 1.2 ")

Capillary blood testing is typically used when repetitive sampling is needed. However, not all blood tests can be performed on capillary blood, and some clinical conditions make capillary blood testing inappropriate, such as when a client is hypotensive with limited venous return.

### Review how to perform capillary blood glucose testing in the “[Blood Glucose Monitoring](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingskills/chapter/19-2-blood-glucose-monitoring/)” section of the “Specimen Collection” chapter of Open RN [Nursing Skills](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingskills/).

#### Arterial Blood Sampling

**Arterial blood sampling** occurs when blood is obtained via puncture into an artery by specially trained registered nurses and other health care personnel, such as respiratory therapists, physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Arterial blood collection is most commonly performed to assess the body’s acid-base balance in a diagnostic test called an arterial blood gas. (For more information on arterial blood gas interpretation, please review Open RN _Nursing Fundamentals_ [Chapter 15](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingfundamentals/chapter/15-5-acid-base-balance/)). The most common access site for arterial blood sampling is the radial artery. See [Figure 1.3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.3/?report=objectonly)\[[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for an image of arterial blood sampling. Arterial blood tests are known to be more painful for the patient than venipuncture and have a higher risk of complications such as bleeding and arterial occlusion with subsequent ischemia to the area distal to the puncture.

[![Figure 1.3 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/bin/ch1therapy-Image007.gif)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.3/?report=objectonly "Figure 1.3 ")

##### Arterial Lines

For clients who require repetitive arterial blood sampling or are hemodynamically unstable, an arterial line may be inserted by specially trained personnel. Arterial lines are specialized tubes that are inserted and maintained in an artery to assist with continuous blood pressure monitoring. They also allow for repeated blood sampling without repetitive puncture, thus decreasing the amount of discomfort for the client. The radial artery is the most common site used for arterial lines. Nurses must not confuse arterial lines with peripheral or central vein access devices. Arterial lines can be distinguished from venous lines by their specialized pressure tubing, which is firm and non-pliable and is connected to a pressure bag to maintain constant pressurized fluid in the tubing. Medications, fluid boluses, and maintenance IV fluids must never be infused through an arterial line. See [Figure 1.3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.3/?report=objectonly)\[[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for an image of arterial lines. The condition of the arterial access site, as well as perfusion of the client’s hand, is continually monitored when an arterial line is in place to prevent complications.

### Intravenous Therapy

In addition to collecting blood samples, nurses also access clients’ veins to administer intravenous therapy.**Intravenous therapy (IV therapy)** involves the administration of substances such as fluids, electrolytes, blood products, nutrition, or medications directly into a client’s vein. The intravenous route is preferred to administer fluid and medications when rapid onset of the medication or fluid is needed. The direct administration of medication into the bloodstream allows for a more rapid onset of medication actions, restoration of hydration, and correction of nutritional deficits. IV therapy is often used to restore fluids and/or electrolyte balances more efficiently than what would be achieved via the oral route.

#### Fluid Balance

Fluid balance is an important part of optimal cellular functioning, and administration of fluids via the venous system provides an efficient way to quickly correct fluid imbalances. Additionally, many individuals who are physically unwell may not be able to tolerate fluids administered through their gastrointestinal tract, so IV administration is necessary.

When clients experience deficient fluid volume, intravenous (IV) fluids are often used to restore fluid to the intravascular compartment or to facilitate the movement of fluid between compartments through the process of osmosis. There are three types of IV fluids: isotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic.\[[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]

### Review movement of fluid between compartments of the body in the “[Basic Fluid and Electrolyte Concepts](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingfundamentals/chapter/15-2-basic-fluid-and-electrolyte-concepts/)” section of the “Fluids and Electrolytes” chapter in Open RN [Nursing Fundamentals](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingfundamentals/).

##### Isotonic Solutions

**Isotonic solutions** are IV fluids that have a similar concentration of dissolved particles as found in the blood. Examples of isotonic IV solutions are 0.9% normal saline (0.9% NaCl) or lactated ringers (LR). Because the concentration of isotonic IV fluid is similar to the concentration of blood, the fluid stays in the intravascular space, and osmosis does not cause fluid movement between cells. See [Figure 1.4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.4/?report=objectonly)\[[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for an illustration of isotonic IV solution administration that does not cause osmotic movement of fluid. Isotonic solutions are typically used for patients with fluid volume deficit (also called hypovolemia) to raise their blood pressure. However, infusion of too much isotonic fluid can cause excessive fluid volume (also referred to as hypervolemia).\[[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]

[![Figure 1.4 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/bin/ch1therapy-Image008.gif)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.4/?report=objectonly "Figure 1.4 ")

#### [Figure 1.4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.4/?report=objectonly)

Isotonic IV Solution Causes No Osmotic Fluid Movement

##### Hypotonic Solutions

**Hypotonic solutions** have a lower concentration of dissolved solutes than blood. An example of a hypotonic IV solution is 0.45% normal saline (0.45% NaCl). When hypotonic IV solutions are infused, it results in a decreased concentration of dissolved solutes in the blood as compared to the intracellular space. This imbalance causes osmotic movement of water from the intravascular compartment into the intracellular space. For this reason, hypotonic fluids are used to treat cellular dehydration. See [Figure 1.5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.5/?report=objectonly)\[[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for an illustration of the osmotic movement of fluid into a cell when a hypotonic IV solution is administered, causing lower concentration of solutes (pink molecules) in the bloodstream compared to within the cell.\[[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]

[![Figure 1.5 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/bin/ch1therapy-Image009.gif)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.5/?report=objectonly "Figure 1.5 ")

#### [Figure 1.5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.5/?report=objectonly)

Hypotonic IV Fluid Causes Osmotic Fluid Movement Into Cells

However, if too much fluid moves out of the intravascular compartment into cells, cerebral edema can occur. It is also possible to cause worsening hypovolemia and hypotension if too much fluid moves out of the intravascular space and into the cells. Therefore, client status should be monitored carefully when hypotonic solutions are infused.\[[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]

##### Hypertonic Solutions

**Hypertonic solutions** have a higher concentration of dissolved particles than blood. An example of hypertonic IV solution is 3% normal saline (3% NaCl). When infused, hypertonic fluids cause an increased concentration of dissolved solutes in the intravascular space compared to the cells. This causes the osmotic movement of water out of the cells and into the intravascular space to dilute the solutes in the blood. See [Figure 1.6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.6/?report=objectonly)\[[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for an illustration of osmotic movement of fluid out of a cell when hypertonic IV fluid is administered due to a higher concentration of solutes (pink molecules) in the bloodstream compared to the cell.

[![Figure 1.6 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/bin/ch1therapy-Image010.gif)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.6/?report=objectonly "Figure 1.6 ")

When administering hypertonic fluids, it is essential to monitor for signs of hypervolemia, such as breathing difficulties and elevated blood pressure. Additionally, if hypertonic solutions with sodium are given, the client’s serum sodium level should be closely monitored.\[[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]

Solution Causes Osmotic Movement of Fluid Out of Cells

See [Figure 1.7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.7/?report=objectonly)\[[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for an illustration comparing how different types of IV solutions affect red blood cell size.

#### [Figure 1.7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.7/?report=objectonly)

Comparison of Osmotic Effects of Hypertonic, Isotonic, and Hypotonic IV Fluids on Red Blood Cells

IV fluids are considered medications. As with all medications, nurses must check the rights of medication administration according to agency policy before administering IV fluids. What began as five rights of mediation administration has been extended to eight rights according to the American Nurses Association. These eight rights include the following\[[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]:

-   Right Patient
    
-   Right Medication
    
-   Right Dose
    
-   Right Time
    
-   Right Route
    
-   Right Documentation
    
-   Right Reason
    
-   Right Response
    

With any IV infusion, it is important for the nurse to pay close attention to the provider’s order and make sure that it contains the specific type of fluid, any additives or medications, amount to be infused, rate of infusion, and the length of time that the therapy should continue. The nurse should also carefully assess a client’s hydration status and oral intake to ensure that IV fluids are stopped appropriately as a client’s condition changes. For example, weight should be assessed daily for clients receiving IV fluids to monitor for fluid overload.

### Review how to check the rights of medication administration in the “[Administration of Enteral Medications](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingskills/chapter/15-2-basic-concepts-of-administering-medications/)” chapter of Open RN [Nursing Skills](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingskills/).

#### Electrolyte Imbalance

In addition to rapidly improving hydration status, IV fluids may also be administered to rapidly correct electrolyte imbalances. Infusing fluids with electrolytes such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium can correct electrolyte imbalances more rapidly and effectively than by oral supplementation.

Electrolytes administered via the IV route must always be administered cautiously at the correct infusion rate because over supplementation can be deadly. For example, potassium infusions administered too rapidly into a client’s system can cause sudden cardiac arrest.

#### Blood Administration

Whole blood and blood components are administered by IV infusion. Blood is typically administered through larger-sized IV catheters. Read more information about blood administration in the “[Administer Blood Products](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingadvancedskills/chapter/3-1-introduction/)” chapter.

#### Nutrition

Nutritional therapy can be administered through an intravenous route for clients who do not have an adequately functioning gastrointestinal tract and/or are unable to take in food or fluids appropriately. Peripheral nutrition may be ordered through a peripheral IV site for nutritional needs such as albumin replacement.

**Total parenteral nutrition** **(TPN)** may be ordered for a client based on their specific electrolyte and/or nutritional needs. TPN is a very concentrated solution that must be administered via a central line. Central lines are placed in a larger vessel rather than a smaller, peripheral vessel. Accessing a central vessel requires additional training and expertise to prevent complications with insertion and is further discussed in the “[Manage Central Lines](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingadvancedskills/chapter/4-1-introduction/)” chapter. If a nurse receives an order for TPN therapy for a client who does not have central line access, the order should be clarified with the prescribing provider.

#### Medications

The IV route is preferred for the administration of many medications when immediate onset is required. For example, many types of pain medications can be given directly into the bloodstream with a much more rapid onset of action than if they were to be administered orally. Rapid relief of pain can be achieved in minutes rather than hours required for oral medications to reach their peak. Rapid onset can also be achieved with other medications such as those used to treat cardiac emergencies or severe allergic reactions to quickly restore clients to optimal body functioning. Additional information about IV administration of medications is discussed in the “[Administer IV Push Medications](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingadvancedskills/chapter/2-1-introduction/)” chapter. Additional information about administration of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is discussed in the “[Specialized Infusions](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingadvancedskills/chapter/1-7-specialized-infusions/)” section of this chapter.

### IV Administration Equipment

Intravenous (IV) substances are administered through flexible plastic tubing called an IV administration set. The IV administration set connects the bag of solution to the client’s IV access site. There are two major types of IV administration sets: primary administration sets and secondary administration sets. Administration sets require routine replacement to prevent infection. Follow agency policy regarding tubing changes before initiating a new bag of fluid or medications.

#### Primary Administration Sets

Primary administration sets can be used to infuse continuous or intermittent fluids, electrolytes, or medications. These substances may be administered by infusion pump or by gravity, and each method requires its own type of administration set.

Primary fluids are typically administered using an IV pump. An IV pump is the safest method of administration to ensure specific amounts of fluid are administered. The rate of infusion through an IV pump is typically calculated in mL/hour.

For infusion by gravity, a primary IV administration set can be a macro-drip or a micro-drip solution set. Macro-drip sets are used for routine primary infusions for adults. Micro-drip IV tubing is used in pediatric or neonatal care where small amounts of fluids are administered over a long period of time. A macro-drip infusion set delivers fluid at 10, 15, or 20 drops per milliliter, whereas a micro-drip infusion set delivers 60 drops per milliliter. The drop factor is located on the packaging of the IV tubing and is important to verify when calculating medication administration rates.

Primary IV administration sets consist of the following parts:

-   **Sterile spike:** Used to spike the IV fluid bag and must be kept sterile.
    
-   **Roller clamp:** Used to regulate the speed or stop an infusion by gravity.
    
-   **Drip chamber:** Allows air to rise out from a fluid so that it is not passed onto the client. The drip chamber should be kept ¼ to ½ full of solution. When setting a rate by gravity to “drops per minute,” the dripping from this chamber is counted.
    
-   **Backcheck valve:** Prevents fluid or medication from travelling up into the primary IV bag.
    
-   **Access ports:** Used to infuse secondary medications and to administer IV push medications. These may also be referred to as “Y ports.”
    

#### Secondary Administration Sets

Secondary IV administration sets are used to intermittently administer a secondary medication, such as an antibiotic, while the primary IV is also running. Secondary IV tubing is shorter in length than primary tubing and is connected to a primary line via an access port above the infusion pump. The infusion pump is then set at the prescribed secondary infusion rate while the secondary medication is administered. By hanging the secondary medication bag higher than the primary bag, gravity pulls fluid from the secondary bag until it is empty rather than the primary bag.

Secondary medications may be “piggybacked” into primary infusion lines so the solution from the primary fluid line can be used to prime the secondary tubing. To prime the secondary tubing, after the secondary tubing is connected to the primary tubing, the bag connected to the secondary tubing is held lower than the primary bag, causing fluid from the primary tubing to backflow up the secondary tubing. This eliminates air from the secondary tubing.

See [Figure 1.8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.8/?report=objectonly)\[[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for an illustration of the setup of primary and secondary administration sets for primary administration of fluids and secondary administration of medication by gravity. See [Figure 1.9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.9/?report=objectonly)\[[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for an image of an IV infusion pump.

#### Priming IV Tubing

Primary administration sets, secondary administration sets, and extension tubing must be primed with IV solution to prevent air from entering the client’s circulatory system and causing an air embolism. Priming refers to the process of filling the IV tubing with IV solution prior to attaching it to the client. Review steps for setting up and priming primary and secondary administration sets using the information in the following box.

### Review checklists of steps for “[Primary IV Solution Administration](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingskills/chapter/23-5-checklist-for-primary-iv-solution-administration/)” and “[Secondary IV Solution Administration](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingskills/chapter/23-6-checklist-for-secondary-iv-solution-administration/)” in the “IV Therapy Management” chapter of Open RN [Nursing Skills](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingskills/).

#### Infection Control

Aseptic technique must be maintained throughout all IV therapy procedures, including initiation of IV access, preparing and maintaining IV equipment, administering IV fluids and medications, and discontinuing an IV system. Hand hygiene and strict aseptic technique must be performed when handling all IV equipment. These standards can be reviewed in the “[Aseptic Technique](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingskills/chapter/4-3-asceptic-technique/)” chapter in Open RN _Nursing Skills_. Additionally, if an IV catheter or IV administration set should become contaminated by contact with a nonsterile surface, it should be replaced with a new one to prevent introducing bacteria or other contaminants into the system.

### Types of Venous Access

There are several types of venous access devices used to administer IV therapy that are categorized as peripheral devices or central devices. Venous access device selection is tailored to each client’s needs and to the type, duration, and frequency of infusion.

#### Peripheral Devices

Peripheral venous access devices are commonly used for short-term IV therapy in the hospital setting. A **peripheral IV** is a intravenous catheter inserted by percutaneous venipuncture into a peripheral vein and held in place with a sterile transparent dressing. The transparent dressing helps to keep the site sterile, prevents accidental dislodgement, and allows the nurse to visualize the insertion site through the dressing. A securement device may be added to prevent accidental dislodgement.

The client’s upper extremities (hands and arms) are the preferred sites for insertion. However, a potential limitation of using the hand veins is they are smaller than the cephalic, basilic, or brachial veins in the arm. If the client requires rapid infusions where a larger gauge IV is warranted, the larger veins in the upper arm should be considered.

Peripheral IVs are used for short-term infusions of fluids, medications, or blood. Peripheral IVs are easy to monitor and can be inserted at the bedside by nurses and other trained professionals. After IV access has been obtained, the hub of an intravenous catheter is attached to a short extension set or a primary IV administration set. Luer lock connectors on the extension tubing and/or administration sets permit syringes to be attached to administer medications or fluid flushes.

**Saline lock** refers to the use of a short extension set that allows IV access without requiring ongoing IV infusions. When not in use, the lock is flushed with saline according to agency policy and clamped to ensure the site remains sterile and blood does not flow out of the extension tubing. See [Figure 1.10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.10/?report=objectonly)\[[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for an image of a saline lock.

[![Figure 1.10 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/bin/ch1therapy-Image014.gif)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.10/?report=objectonly "Figure 1.10 ")

If the client requires continuous infusion of IV fluids, the extension tubing from the IV catheter is connected to a primary IV administration set. The IV tubing can be run through an infusion pump to administer fluids or medications at a programmed rate of infusion (typically calculated in mL/hour) or via gravity by setting a drip rate with the roller clamp (typically calculated at drops/minute). Manufacturers list the drop rate on the IV packaging. Because of the risk of error that can occur with infusion by gravity, many agencies require the use of an infusion pump to ensure correct flow rate.

##### Contraindications to Peripheral IV Access Sites

Before inserting a peripheral IV, the client should be assessed for contraindications related to insertion sites in the upper extremities. For example, clients who have a history of lumpectomy or mastectomy, an arteriovenous fistula, or current lymphedema often have restrictions that prohibit venipuncture into the affected extremity.\[[19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] Additionally, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), fractures, contractures, or extensive scarring may also prohibit the placement of a peripheral IV. Hospitalized patients may have signage or a bracelet stating “limb alert” to alert heath care professionals to these conditions.

##### Midline Peripheral Catheters

**Midline peripheral catheters** have a larger catheter (i.e., 16-18 gauge) that allow for rapid infusions. Insertion is ultrasound-guided and can be inserted by RNs with additional training or other trained professionals. Midline catheters are typically inserted into the basilic, cephalic, or brachial veins of the upper arm with the tip placed near the level of the axilla. They are much longer and inserted deeper than a peripheral IV, but do not extend into a central vessel, so are not considered a central line. Therefore, they have a lower risk of infection than central venous access. Any medication that can be administered through a peripheral line can be administered via a midline peripheral catheter. They can also be used for longer duration than traditional peripheral venous access, which is ideal for clients needing extended hospital stays or IV access. Based on agency policy, midline catheters may also be used for blood sample collection, thus limiting the number of venipunctures a client receives. Site care for a midline peripheral catheter is similar to a peripheral IV dressing change.\[[20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\],\[[21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]

#### Central Venous Access Devices

A **central venous access device (CVAD)** is a type of vascular access that involves the insertion of a tube into a vein in the neck, chest, or groin and threaded into a central vein (most commonly the internal jugular, subclavian, or femoral) and advanced until the tip of the catheter resides within the inferior vena cava, superior vena cava, or right atrium.\[[22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] Only specially trained health professionals may insert central venous access devices, but nurses provide routine care of CVADs, including dressing changes. See [Figure 1.11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.11/?report=objectonly)\[[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for an image of a central line requiring a dressing change.

[![Figure 1.11 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/bin/ch1therapy-Image015.gif)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.11/?report=objectonly "Figure 1.11 ")

A central venous access device can be left in for longer periods of time and is useful for administering concentrated medications and fluids, such as TPN or hyperosmotic fluids, that would be otherwise irritating to smaller peripheral veins. However, central venous access devices have an increased risk for the development of bloodstream infections, so strict aseptic technique is required during insertion and maintenance. Central venous access devices are further discussed in the “[Manage Central Lines](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingadvancedskills/chapter/4-1-introduction/)” chapter.

##### Peripheral Inserted Central Catheters

A **peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC)** is a thin, flexible tube inserted into a vein in the upper arm and guided into the superior vena cava. It is used to give intravenous fluids, blood transfusions, chemotherapy, and other medications requiring a central line. It can also be used for blood sampling. A PICC may stay in place for weeks or months and helps avoid the need for repeated needlesticks. PICC lines are further discussed in the “[Manage Central Lines](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingadvancedskills/chapter/4-2-basic-concepts/)” chapter.

**General Guidelines for IV Therapy**

The following are general guidelines for peripheral IV therapy\[[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]:

-   IV fluid therapy is ordered by a provider. The order must include the type of solution or medication, total amount of fluid, rate of infusion, duration, date, and time.
    
-   IV therapy is an invasive procedure. Significant complications can occur if the wrong amount of IV fluids or incorrect medication is given or if aseptic technique is not strictly followed.
    
-   Nurses must understand the indications and duration for IV therapy for each client. Practice guidelines recommend that clients receiving IV therapy for more than six days should be assessed for an intermediate or long-term device such as a central venous access device (CVAD).
    
-   Hospitalized patients may have an order for a small hourly infusion rate, such as 10-20 mL/hour, historically referred to in practice as a “to keep open” (TKO) or “keep vein open” (KVO) rate.
    
-   IV administration sets require routine replacement to promote client safety and reduce the risk of infection. Primary and secondary continuous administration sets used to administer solutions other than lipids, blood, or blood products are typically changed every 96 hours, or up to every 7 days, as directed by agency policy and/or the manufacturer’s instructions. Administration sets should also be changed if contamination or compromise in the integrity of the product or system is suspected. Secondary administration sets that are detached from a primary administration set are typically changed every 24 hours or as directed by agency policy. Administration sets should be labelled according to agency policy with the date of initiation or the date of change indicated.\[[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]

## 1.3. PERIPHERAL IV ACCESS

The initiation and maintenance of a peripheral venous access includes selecting an appropriate site, selecting an appropriate IV catheter and size, establishing IV access, and monitoring for potential complications. The nurse also incorporates life span considerations while following general guidelines for maintaining peripheral venous access sites.

### Selection of Venous Access Site Selection

The process of IV start and vessel cannulation includes a comprehensive vein search, identification, and assessment process. Veins in the upper extremities (hands and arms) are typically the preferred sites for insertion. The nurse should be systematic when assessing potential vessels for insertion, examining potential sites both visually and through palpation while progressing up the patient’s extremity. The arms should be rotated so that vessels on the dorsal surface can be considered as well. Taking time to identify the best access site will increase the chances for successful cannulation and decrease discomfort for the patient. See [Figure 1.12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.12/?report=objectonly)\[[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for an illustration of vein anatomy in the upper extremity.

[![Figure 1.12 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/bin/ch1therapy-Image016.gif)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.12/?report=objectonly "Figure 1.12 ")

The veins of the hands are common places to begin one’s assessment. These veins on the dorsal surface of the hand are typically easily visualized and palpated due to the proximity to the surface of the skin. See [Figure 1.13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.13/?report=objectonly)\[[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for an image of the veins in a hand. Veins on the palmar side of the wrist should be avoided due to potential nerve damage. A limitation of using hand veins for venous access is they are smaller than the cephalic, basilic, or brachial veins in the arm. For example, if the patient requires rapid infusion of fluid or administration of blood products, a large-gauge IV cannula is typically placed in large vein in the upper arm.

[![Figure 1.13 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/bin/ch1therapy-Image017.gif)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.13/?report=objectonly "Figure 1.13 ")

If no suitable veins are found on the hand, the nurse should progress up the arm and continue to assess for good access sites. The basilic and cephalic veins are good alternatives for establishing IV access. The brachial vein can be considered, but caution must be used due to its location near the brachial artery in the antecubital fossa. Palpating for a pulse and then avoiding the area where the pulse is located can help ensure cannulation occurs into a vein rather than the artery.\[[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]

Nurses must also reflect on the purpose for venous access to determine the appropriate access site and catheter lumen size. For example, consider the venous access site required to obtain a blood sample specimen versus that to provide intravenous fluid administration. For blood sampling, the nurse should direct attention to the large veins located in the antecubital fossa (i.e., the interior aspect of the elbow) because the veins are larger in size and can be accessed frequently. However, these veins are not optimal for routine IV fluid administration because every time the patient bends their elbow, a mechanical obstruction in the IV catheter may occur. Despite the potential disadvantage of mechanical obstruction when accessing veins in the antecubital fossa, the nurse may still decide to access veins in the antecubital fossa if rapid IV access is needed or if the patient is only receiving intermittent short-term infusions. In this manner, the purpose for a patient’s venous access plays a strong role in determining the appropriate access site.

When considering a potential site for IV cannulation, it is important to note that a catheter must be inserted and threaded for a short distance into the vein. Veins that have ¼- to ½-inch sections of straight surface are usually easily accessed. Suitable IV access sites include lengths of veins that feel spongy and resilient to the touch. Veins that bifurcate (i.e., divide into branches), narrow significantly, or are curved can be difficult to access and thread the cannula. Nurses should also palpate for knobby bumps in a vein that may indicate the presence of valves in that area. Valves can be difficult to cannulate through and, therefore, should be avoided.

If a patient has several suitable venous access sites, preference should be given to establishing an access site on their nondominant hand or arm. Patients typically use their dominant hand when moving to reposition themselves, take meals or fluids, or operate the television remote. These movements can increase the chance of the cannula dislodging from the vein.\[[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]

Additional considerations for vein selection include avoiding extremities with restrictions such as those with a previous history of mastectomy, lymph node dissection, or arteriovenous (A/V) fistula; the presence of a cast or other assistive device; or those with conditions causing reduced sensation such as paralysis or stroke. The presence of an IV cannula in extremities with these conditions increases the risk for localized infection and other complications.

The nurse should also consider the condition of the patient’s skin when selecting an access site. Skin that is scarred can be fibrous and tough to penetrate with a needle, causing increased discomfort. Sites below a recent venipuncture or IV access site should also be avoided due the potential for fluids to seep out of the site. Additionally, skin that is tattooed or extremities with edema should also be avoided whenever possible. Tattoos and edema make a vein not only more difficult to identify, but also more difficult to assess for signs of complications such as cannula dislodgement and the presence of fluid leaking into subcutaneous tissues.

There are many methods that nurses can use to dilate veins and determine the presence of suitable access sites if the veins are not visually apparent. A simple method is to apply a single-use tourniquet. The tourniquet should be snug but still allow for the presence of arterial blood flow. Blood flow can be easily assessed by applying the tourniquet and assessing the presence of the radial pulse. Tourniquets should only be applied for short periods of time and released periodically during the vein search and selection process to ensure resolution of systemic blood flow. In a similar manner, a blood pressure cuff can be also applied and pumped up for a short period of time.

Application of warmth can also be helpful for vein identification. Wrapping the upper extremities in warm blankets, or applying warm compresses, promotes vessel dilation. The blankets or compresses should be in place for short intervals (i.e., 3-5 minutes) to allow time for the vessels to respond to the warm stimuli.

Placing the upper extremities in a dependent position is another useful method for enhancing vessel dilation. Allowing the arm and hand to hang dependently (i.e., below the level of the heart) allows venous blood to migrate by gravity into the lower arms and hands. The pooling of venous blood into the small vessels of the hands promotes vessel dilation and vein identification.

In addition to promoting vessel dilation, nurses may also be trained in some facilities to use equipment to visually detect veins, such as illumination lights or ultrasound equipment. Some agencies also have specially trained venous access teams who insert intravenous lines and can be consulted if vascular access proves challenging.

Many patients have had previous experience with IVs and can provide helpful information regarding strategies for success. For example, if a patient states, “My veins often ‘roll’ when they try to start an IV,” the nurse should take special caution to anchor the vessel when puncturing the skin.

Nurses should restrict IV insertion attempts to no more than two attempts per clinician. Multiple unsuccessful attempts cause pain to the client, delay treatment, limit future vascular access, increase cost, increase the risk for complications, and decrease trust in the nurse. After two unsuccessful attempts, the nurse should seek a clinician with a higher skill level or consider alternative routes of medication administration.\[[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]

### Catheter Size and Type Selection

Peripheral IV catheters are available in a variety of sizes, most commonly ranging from 14 gauge to 24 gauge. Note that the lower the gauge size, the wider the diameter of the catheter, with 14-gauge catheters allowing for the greatest flow rate.\[[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] Catheter sizes are color coded to allow for easy identification of the catheter size after a vein is accessed. See [Figure 1.14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.14/?report=objectonly)\[[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for colors associated with IV catheter sizes and their associated flow rates.

[![Figure 1.14 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/bin/ch1therapy-Image018.gif)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.14/?report=objectonly "Figure 1.14 ")

Nurses must consider the purpose for venous access, along with assessment of the client’s vessel size, when selecting an IV catheter to attempt cannulation. Catheters with a smaller gauge (i.e., larger diameter) permit infusion of viscous fluids, such as blood products, at a faster rate with decreased opportunity for catheter occlusion.\[[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] Additionally, an appropriately sized catheter also allows for adequate blood flow around the catheter itself. The most common IV catheter size for adult patients is 18- or 20-gauge catheters. However, frail elderly patients and children have smaller vasculature, so a 22-gauge catheter is often preferred.

There are different manufacturer brands of IV catheters, but all include a beveled hollow needle, flashback chamber in which one can visualize blood return when entering the vein, and a flexible catheter that is left in the vein after the catheter has been threaded into the vein and the needle removed.

IV insertion equipment varies among institutions, but common types include shielded IV catheters or winged (i.e., “butterfly”) devices. Variation is often related to the presence of a stabilizing device at the site of insertion, as well as the presence of short extension tubing. For shielded catheter types, the stabilizing device and extension tubing are typically added to the catheter itself and not included with the cannulation needle. See [Figure 1.15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.15/?report=objectonly)\[[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for an image of shielded IV catheters.

[![Figure 1.15 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/bin/ch1therapy-Image019.gif)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.15/?report=objectonly "Figure 1.15 ")

Nurses must ensure the selected size and type of IV catheter are appropriate for the procedure or infusion that is ordered because not all peripheral IV catheters are suitable for all procedures. For example, if a procedure requires the infusion of contrast dye, a specific size infusion port is required.

Despite the wide variation in catheter equipment that is available, there has been significant focus among manufacturers regarding the need for safety equipment during venipuncture. Many devices utilize mechanisms to self-contain needles within a plastic sheath after withdrawal from the client. These devices can be activated through a button in the devices or a manual trigger initiated by the individual attempting cannulation. Regardless of the type of safety lock, it is important to utilize the equipment as intended and never attempt to disable or override the mechanism. These mechanisms are important to help prevent accidental needlesticks or injury with a contaminated needle after it has been removed from the patient. Additionally, after cannulation is attempted, the individual who attempted cannulation is responsible for ensuring all needles are disposed of in a sharps container. It is good practice to be aware of how many sharps were brought into the room, opened, and disposed. This helps to ensure that any needles are not inadvertently left in a patient’s bed, tray table, floor, etc. Nurses must be familiar with the equipment used at the health care facility and receive orientation on the specific mechanics related to the equipment and safety practices.

### Monitoring for Potential Complications

Several potential complications may arise from peripheral intravenous therapy. It is the responsibility of the nurse to monitor for signs and symptoms of complications and intervene appropriately. Complications can be categorized as local or systemic. See [Table 1.3a](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/table/ch1therapy.T.local_complications_of_peri/?report=objectonly) for potential local complications of peripheral IV therapy.

### Table 1.3a

Local Complications of Peripheral IV Therapy\[[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\],\[[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]

| Complications | Potential Causes and Prevention | Treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Phlebitis: The inflammation of the vein’s inner lining, the tunica intima. Clinical indications are localized redness, pain, heat, purulent drainage, and swelling that can track up the vein leading to a palpable venous cord.** | **Mechanical causes:** Inflammation of the vein’s inner lining can be caused by the cannula rubbing and irritating the vein. To prevent mechanical inflammation, use the smallest gauge possible to deliver the medication or required fluids.  
**Chemical causes:** Inflammation of the vein’s inner lining can be caused by medications or fluids with high alkaline, acidic, or hypertonic qualities. To avoid chemical phlebitis, follow the parenteral drug therapy guidelines in a drug reference resource for administering IV medications, including the appropriate amount of solution and rate of infusion.  
**Infectious causes:** May be related to emergent VAD insertions, poor aseptic technique, or contaminated dressings. | **Chemical phlebitis:** Evaluate infusion therapy and the need for different vascular access, different medication, slower rate of infusion, or more dilute infusate. If indicated, remove the Vascular Access Device (VAD).\[[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]  
**Transient mechanical phlebitis:** May be treatable by stabilizing the catheter, applying heat, elevating limb, and providing analgesics as needed. Consider requesting other pharmacologic interventions such as anti-inflammatory agents if needed. Monitor site for 24 hours post-insertion, and if signs and symptoms persist, remove the catheter.\[[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]  
**Infectious phlebitis:** If purulent drainage is present or infection is suspected, remove the catheter and obtain a culture of the purulent drainage and catheter tip. Monitor for signs of systemic infection.\[[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] |
| **Infiltration: A condition that occurs when a nonvesicant solution is inadvertently administered into surrounding tissue. Signs and symptoms include pain, swelling, redness, the skin surrounding the insertion site is cool to touch, there is a change in the quality or flow of IV, the skin is tight around the IV site, IV fluid is leaking from IV site, or there are frequent alarms on the IV pump.** | Infiltration is one of the most common complications in infusion therapy involving an IV catheter.\[[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] For this reason, the patency of an IV site must always be checked before administering IV push medications.  
Infiltration can be caused by piercing the vein, excessive patient movement, a dislodged or incorrectly placed IV catheter, or too rapid infusion of fluids or medications into a fragile vein.  
Always secure a peripheral IV catheter with tape or a stabilization device to avoid accidental dislodgement. Avoid sites that are areas of flexion. | Stop the infusion and remove the cannula. Follow agency policy related to infiltration. |
| **Extravasation: A condition that occurs when vesicant (an irritating solution or medication) is administered and inadvertently leaks into surrounding tissue and causes damage. It is characterized by the same signs and symptoms as infiltration but also includes burning, stinging, redness, blistering, or necrosis of the tissue.** | Extravasation has the same potential causes of infiltration but with worse consequences because of the effects of vesicants. Extravasation can result in severe tissue injury and necrosis. For this reason, known vesicant medications should be administered via central lines. | Stop the infusion. Detach all administration sets and aspirate from the catheter hub prior to removing the catheter to remove vesicant medication from the catheter lumen and as much as possible from the subcutaneous tissue.\[[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]  
Follow agency policy regarding extravasation of specific medications. For example, toxic medications have a specific treatment plan. |
| **Hemorrhage: Bleeding from the IV access site.** | Bleeding occurs when the IV catheter becomes dislodged. | If dislodgement occurs, apply pressure with gauze to the site until the bleeding stops and then apply a sterile transparent dressing. |
| **Local infection: Infection at the site is indicated by purulent drainage, typically two to three days after an IV site is started.** | Local infection is often caused by nonadherence to aseptic technique during IV initiation or IV maintenance or the dressing becomes contaminated or non-intact over the access site. | Remove the cannula and clean the site using sterile technique. If infection is suspected, remove the catheter and obtain a culture of the purulent drainage and catheter tip. Monitor for signs of systemic infection. |
| **Nerve** injury\[[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] | Paresthesia-type pain occurring during venipuncture or during an indwelling IV catheter can indicate nerve injury. | Immediately remove the cannula, notify the provider, and document findings in the chart. |

In addition to local complications that can occur at the site of IV insertion, there are many systemic complications that nurses must monitor for when initiating peripheral IV access, as well as monitoring a client receiving IV therapy. See [Table 1.3b](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/table/ch1therapy.T.systemic_complications_of_p/?report=objectonly) for a list of systemic complications, signs, symptoms, and treatment.

### Table 1.3b

Systemic Complications of Peripheral IV Therapy\[[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]

| Complication | Signs, Symptoms, and Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Pulmonary Edema | Pulmonary edema, also known as fluid overload or circulatory overload, is a condition caused by excess fluid accumulation in the lungs due to excessive fluid in the circulatory system. It is characterized by decreased oxygen saturation; increased respiratory rate; fine or coarse crackles in the lung bases; restlessness; breathlessness; dyspnea; and coughing up pink, frothy sputum. Pulmonary edema requires prompt medical attention and treatment. If pulmonary edema is suspected, raise the head of the bed, apply oxygen, take vital signs, complete a cardiovascular assessment, and immediately notify the provider. |
| Air Embolism | Air embolism refers to the presence of air in the cardiovascular system. It occurs when air is introduced into the venous system and travels to the right ventricle and/or pulmonary circulation. Air embolisms can occur during catheter insertion, changing IV bags, adding secondary medication administration, and catheter removal. Inadvertent administration of 10 mL of air can have serious and fatal consequences. However, small air bubbles are tolerated by most patients. Signs and symptoms of an air embolism include sudden shortness of breath, continued coughing, breathlessness, shoulder or neck pain, agitation, feeling of impending doom, light-headedness, hypotension, wheezing, increased heart rate, altered mental status, and jugular venous distension.  
If an air embolism is suspected, occlude the source of air entry. Place the patient in a Trendelenburg position on their left side (if not contraindicated), apply oxygen at 100%, obtain vital signs, and immediately notify the provider.  
To prevent air embolisms, perform the following steps when administering IV therapy: ensure the drip chamber is one-third to one-half filled, remove all air from the IV tubing by priming it prior to attaching it to the client, use precautions when changing IV bags or adding secondary medication bags, ensure all IV connections are tight, and ensure clamps are used when the IV system is not in use. |
| Catheter Embolism | A catheter embolism occurs when a small part of the cannula breaks off and flows into the vascular system. When removing a peripheral IV cannula, inspect the catheter tip to ensure the end is intact. Notify the provider immediately if the catheter tip is not intact when it is removed. |
| Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection (CR-BSI) | Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI) is caused by microorganisms introduced into the bloodstream through the puncture site, the hub, or contaminated IV tubing or IV solution, leading to bacteremia or sepsis. A CR-BSI is a hospital-acquired preventable infection and considered an adverse event. A CR-BSI is diagnosed when infection occurs with one positive blood culture in a patient with a vascular device (or a patient who had a vascular device within 48 hours before the infection) with no apparent source for the infection other than the vascular access device. Treatment for CR-BSI is IV antibiotic therapy.  
To prevent CR-BSI, it is vital to perform hand hygiene prior to care and maintenance of an IV system and to use strict aseptic technique for care and maintenance of all IV therapy procedures. |

### Life Span Considerations

IV initiation procedures vary significantly for pediatric patients and older adults due to patient size and variation in vessel size and condition. For example, in neonatal patients, venous access may be achieved through cannulation of a vein in their hand, foot, or scalp. However, IV initiation into a scalp vessel requires specific modifications and additional training. Additionally, use of a lower extremity for venous access should be specifically addressed with the provider prior to any attempt at cannulation to ensure that a lower extremity site is appropriate based on the patient condition.

When working with pediatric patients, it is important to consider the stability of the IV access. Many pediatric patients are very mobile and may not be able to understand the need to leave a saline lock or continuous infusion line in place. Utilizing stabilizing arm boards or gauze wraps may be helpful reminders that also create stability in the line and access site. Many health care organizations have additional tools and strategies to ease IV cannulation for pediatric patients, such as topical anesthetics including lidocaine cream, to minimize discomfort with insertion. Special procedural rooms oriented toward children are often used with helpful visual distractors like dolls, toys, stuffed animals, videos, or support of child life specialists.\[[19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] See [Figure 1.16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.16/?report=objectonly)\[[20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for an image of toys used as distractors with a hospitalized pediatric patient.

[![Figure 1.16 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/bin/ch1therapy-Image020.gif)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.16/?report=objectonly "Figure 1.16 ")

Providing education to the parents regarding the process of the IV start and what might work best for the child ahead of the procedure can be helpful for ensuring cannulation occurs with minimal complications. Parents can often be excellent sources of support when pediatric patients undergo invasive procedures, but it is important that the parents are comfortable and informed regarding their role and the manner in which they will offer assistance.

There are also modifications nurses can make independently based on their clinical knowledge of a patient’s condition. For example, many elderly patients who receive steroids have vessels that are very fragile and difficult to cannulate. Nurses may modify the procedure by omitting the use of a tourniquet. This decreases pressure in the vessel during venipuncture and helps to prevent the vein from rupturing or **“blowing“** (i.e., leaking blood due to rupture). The use of a tourniquet may also be omitted to prevent skin tears.

Many elderly patients have less subcutaneous tissue as a result of the aging process, and the nurse may note that their vessels, particularly those located in the hands, appear more superficial than is seen in younger patients. See [Figure 1.17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.17/?report=objectonly)\[[21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for an image of superficial veins. As a result, the experienced nurse may modify their vessel cannulation technique by inserting the needle at a decreased or shallower angle when attempting cannulation. Decreasing the angle of insertion will provide less chance of passing the needle through the vessel when first puncturing through the skin.\[[22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]

### General Guidelines for Maintaining Peripheral Venous Access Sites

Health care agencies have policies regarding site assessment, flushing, maintenance, and dressing changes. The following general guidelines apply to maintaining peripheral IV access sites:

-   **Site assessment:** In inpatient and nursing facilities, peripherally inserted IV sites should be assessed at least every four hours and more frequently for patients receiving infusions of vesicant medications. Sites should be assessed every 1-2 hours for patients who are critically ill/sedated or have cognitive deficits and every hour for neonatal/pediatric patients.\[[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] In outpatient or home settings, the patient or caregiver should be taught to check the site every four hours during waking hours for signs of complications and immediately report concerns to their health care provider.\[[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]
    
-   **Duration of site:** Traditionally, IV access sites were changed every 72-96 hours, but research indicates no clear difference in rates of infection, phlebitis, mortality, or pain if catheters are kept in place until IV therapy is complete or a complication occurs requiring site discontinuation.\[[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]
    
-   **Routine flushing of saline locks:** When not in continuous use, saline locks should be flushed with two times the amount of external catheter length plus catheter (i.e., 5 mL in adults) with normal saline every 8-12 hours to ensure patency.\[[26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]
    
-   **Securement devices:** To maintain integrity of the IV site and prevent infiltration and other complications, proper securement devices should be used, when available, to keep the IV secure and prevent dislodgement. Examples of securement devices are stat locks, chevron tape, arm boards, and arm wraps.
    
-   **Peripheral IV dressing changes:** Gauze dressings should be changed at least every two days and transparent dressings at least every seven days. They should be changed immediately if the dressing becomes visibly soiled, loosened, dislodged, or if there is any moisture, drainage, blood, or compromised skin.\[[27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]
    
-   **Site care:** Protective measures for the IV site include no tub baths or soaking and wrapping with a protective covering if showering. Restrictive clothing should be avoided, and blood pressure should be taken in an arm without an IV site present.

## 1.4. CHECKLIST: PERFORM VENIPUNCTURE BLOOD DRAW

_\*Disclaimer: Always follow agency policy and manufacturer recommendations_

**Checklist: Perform Venipuncture Blood Draw\[** [**1**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#) **\],\[** [**2**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#) **\]**

-   Verify the provider’s order.
    
-   Review the patient’s medical record for conditions that increase the risk of bleeding or hematoma formation and allergies to antiseptics, adhesive, and latex. Use an alternative product if necessary. Also, check the patient’s medical record for factors that may affect peripheral vasculature.
    
-   Gather the necessary supplies:
    
    -   Clean gloves
        
    -   Antiseptic solution/agent (such as an alcohol wipe, chlorhexidine, or povidone-iodine)
        
    -   Needleless blood sampling access device (vacutainer) or syringes
        
    -   Venipuncture needle or winged collection device
        
    -   Single patient-use tourniquet
        
    -   Blood specimen tubes and labels
        
    -   Needleless connector
        
    -   Labels
        
    -   2” x 2” gauze pads
        
    -   Tape or adhesive bandage
        
    -   Biohazard specimen transport bag or container
        
-   Perform hand hygiene.
    
-   Confirm the patient’s identity using two patient identifiers per agency policy and ask if they have any allergies.
    
-   Provide privacy.
    
-   Explain the procedure.
    
-   Ask whether the patient has ever felt faint, sweaty, or nauseated when having blood drawn. If so, place the patient in a supine position.
    
-   Raise the bed to a working level.
    
-   Perform hand hygiene.
    
-   Put on gloves and, as needed, other personal protective equipment.
    
-   Position the patient’s arm horizontally or slanting slightly downward.
    
-   Inspect the patient’s veins.
    
-   Check if the patient has a history of easy bruising, increased risk of bleeding, compromised circulation, or fragile veins or skin.
    
-   Apply a tourniquet about 2” (5 cm) above the site. Make sure that you can palpate an arterial pulse distal to the tourniquet. Be aware the tourniquet should only be applied for 2 minutes or less.
    
-   Prepare the venipuncture site using an antiseptic agent. Apply the agent using a single-use sterile applicator. Allow the agent to dry completely.
    
-   Immobilize the vein with the nondominant thumb or forefinger and thumb.
    
-   Position the needle holder or syringe with the needle bevel up and the shaft parallel to the path of the vein at a 30-degree angle to the arm.
    
-   Tell the patient you are about to perform the venipuncture.
    
-   Insert the needle into the vein. Push the collection tube into the holder when the vein is cannulated.
    
-   Release the tourniquet when blood begins to flow.
    
-   Remove the first tube from the holder when the first tube fills. Continue to fill the tubes using the correct order of draw to avoid cross-contamination of the sample by additives found in different collection tubes (Review information about [Order of Blood Draw Tubes](https://clsi.org/about/blog/order-of-blood-draw-tubes-and-additives/).)\[[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] Remove each tube from the holder, gently invert it, and return it to its upright position.
    
-   After drawing all samples, place a gauze pad over the puncture site, disengage an evacuated tube, and remove the needle from the vein. Do not remove the needle with the collection tube still in the vacutainer.
    
-   Activate the needle protector safety device, if applicable.
    
-   Apply pressure to the puncture site until bleeding stops.
    
-   Apply an adhesive bandage or tape a gauze bandage to the needle insertion site.
    
-   If a syringe was used to collect the sample instead of a vacutainer, transfer the blood sample immediately to a collection tube.
    
-   Carefully invert each collection tube according to the additive.
    
-   Label all samples in the presence of the patient.
    
-   Place the labeled specimen in a biohazard bag and transport it to the laboratory immediately per agency policy.
    
-   Discard used supplies and place sharps into a sharps container.
    
-   Remove the gloves and perform hand hygiene.
    
-   In an inpatient setting, help the patient into a comfortable position and place personal items, the tray table, and the call light within easy reach. Make sure the patient knows how to use the call light to summon assistance. To ensure the patient’s safety, raise the appropriate number of side rails and lower the bed to the lowest position. Ensure the bed is locked.
    
-   Perform hand hygiene.
    
-   Document the procedure and assessments.
    

**Documentation Cues:**

-   Site and location of vein used, the appearance of the site, and the condition and type of dressing used over the blood draw site
    
-   Date, time, and blood samples drawn
    
-   Patient teaching
    
-   Any unexpected outcomes, related nursing interventions, health care provider notification, and the patient’s response to treatment
    
-   Communication of laboratory results to the provider (if applicable)

## 1.5. CHECKLIST: PERFORM IV INSERTION & IV REMOVAL

_\*Disclaimer: Always follow agency policy and manufacturer recommendations_

**Checklist: IV Insertion\[** [**1**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#) **\],\[** [**2**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#) **\]**

-   Verify the provider’s order.
    
-   Review the patient’s medical record for allergies to antiseptic solutions, adhesives, latex, and anesthetic agents. Also, review the medical record for factors that may affect peripheral vasculature.
    
-   Gather the necessary supplies:
    
    -   Clean/nonsterile gloves
        
    -   Single-use tourniquet
        
    -   Appropriate type and size of peripheral IV catheter based on patient status
        
    -   Needless cap/extension tubing set
        
    -   Appropriate antiseptic agent/pad based on client’s allergy status (chlorhexidine-based, povidone-iodine, or 70% alcohol)
        
    
    -   Sterile 10-mL prefilled syringe (or a syringe specifically designed to generate lower injection pressure) containing preservative-free normal saline solution
        
    -   IV pole
        
    -   Securement device (integrated securement device, subcutaneous anchor securement system, tissue adhesive, or adhesive securement device)
        
    -   Transparent semipermeable dressing
        
    -   Label
        

NOTE: Commercial IV insertion kits come with or without an IV access device. Many facilities keep venipuncture equipment on a tray or cart, enabling increased choice of access devices and easy replacement of contaminated items.

-   Perform hand hygiene.
    
-   Confirm the patient’s identity using at least two patient identifiers and ask if they have any allergies.
    
-   Provide privacy.
    
-   Explain the procedure.
    
-   If the patient is in bed in an inpatient setting, raise the patient’s bed to waist level. Place the patient in a comfortable sitting or reclining position, leaving the arm in a dependent position.
    
-   Apply a tourniquet on an upper extremity to dilate the veins and assess for an appropriate insertion site. Verify the radial pulse. If the intended site is visibly soiled, clean it with soap and water. Clip the hair around the insertion site if needed. Administer a local anesthetic, if indicated and prescribed.
    
-   Assess the veins in the upper extremity and identify potential sites that are easily seen or palpated. Choose an insertion site based on the assessment findings.
    
-   Lightly palpate the site of the selected vein without visible valves or bifurcations with the index and middle fingers of the nondominant hand. Stretch the skin to anchor the vein. If it feels hard or ropelike, select another vein. If the vein is easily palpable but not sufficiently dilated, place the extremity in a dependent position for several seconds or lightly stroke the vessel. Apply dry heat, if necessary.
    
-   Release the tourniquet for site preparation.
    
-   Perform hand hygiene and put on gloves**.**
    
-   Open and prepare the supplies. Flush the needleless cap/extension set with normal saline and keep the syringe attached. Maintain the sterility of the end of the connector.
    
-   Clean the intended insertion site and surrounding skin with a facility-approved antimicrobial, and then allow it to dry completely.
    
-   Reapply the tourniquet. Verify the radial pulse.
    
-   Using the thumb of the nondominant hand, stretch the skin taut below the puncture site to stabilize the vein.
    
-   Tell the patient that the device will be inserted.
    
-   Place the short peripheral catheter on top of the vein at a 10- to 15-degree angle from the skin. Puncture the skin and anterior vein wall, watching for blood to appear in the catheter, flashback chamber, or both. Lower the catheter until almost flush with the skin. Advance the needle slightly into the vein after flashback is observed to ensure the needle tip and cannula are inserted into the vein.
    
-   After inserting the IV catheter into a patient’s vein, do not let go until it has been properly secured to prevent accidental dislodgment.
    
-   While continuing to hold the skin taut, use the device’s push-off tab to separate the catheter from the needle stylet. Advance the catheter into the vein.
    
-   Release the tourniquet.
    
-   Activate the device’s safety mechanism, as applicable, to cover the needle following the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
    
-   Stabilize the catheter hub while attaching the extension set to the catheter hub and tighten the Luer lock, making sure the Luer lock does not come in contact with the patient’s skin and maintaining sterility of the insertion site and Luer lock.
    
-   Slowly aspirate to assess for blood return that is the color and consistency of whole blood. If no blood return occurs, take steps to locate an external cause of obstruction. It may be necessary to slightly withdraw the catheter if the tip is against a valve in the vein.
    
-   If blood return occurs, slowly inject preservative-free normal saline solution into the catheter according to facility policy while ensuring there is no swelling of surrounding tissue.
    
-   Clamp the catheter.
    
-   Remove and discard the syringe.
    
-   Stabilize and secure the catheter using an engineered stabilization device, if available. If an engineered stabilization device is unavailable, secure the catheter with sterile tape.
    
-   Using sterile technique, apply a transparent semipermeable dressing over the insertion site, following the manufacturer’s instructions.
    
-   Curl the extension set to the side and tape it to the inside of the patient’s arm if needed for extra securement.
    
-   Label the dressing with the current date or the date the dressing is due to be changed, as directed by agency policy.
    
-   Discard needle(s) into a sharps container.
    
-   Dispose of used equipment in appropriate receptacles.
    
-   Remove and discard gloves and other personal protective equipment, if worn.
    
-   Perform hand hygiene.
    
-   In an inpatient setting, help the patient into a comfortable position and place personal items, the tray table, and the call light within easy reach. Make sure the patient knows how to use the call light to summon assistance. To ensure the patient’s safety, raise the appropriate number of side rails and lower the bed to the lowest position. Ensure the bed is locked.
    
-   Perform hand hygiene.
    
-   Document the procedure and assessments.

## 1.7. SPECIALIZED INFUSIONS

In addition to the provision of IV fluid therapy and medication administration via the intravenous route, nurses must also be aware of specialized infusions and the safety implications that may be associated with these types of infusions. Two types of specialized infusions include medication administered via a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump and those administered via epidural infusion. There are many unique advantages and risks associated with specialized infusions, and nurses must be aware of the safety implications and associated interventions to ensure quality patient care.

### Patient-Controlled Analgesia

**Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)** is a method of pain management that allows hospitalized patients with severe pain to safely self-administer opioid medications using a programmed pump according to their level of discomfort. A computerized pump contains a syringe of pain medication and is connected directly to a patient’s intravenous (IV) line. Doses of medication can be administered as either a basal (i.e., continuous) rate, self-administered as needed on demand, or a combination of both methods. Doses are self-administered by the patient by pressing a button that initiates a “demand” for medication. However, the pump is programmed to only allow administration of medication every set number of minutes with a maximum dose of medication every hour. These pump settings and the design of the system require the patient to be alert enough to press the button to receive a demand dose. These design features are safety measures to help prevent overmedication that can cause sedation and respiratory depression. However, despite these safety measures it is vital for nurses to closely monitor patients receiving PCA for respiratory depression.\[[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] See [Figure 1.18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.18/?report=objectonly)\[[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for an image of a PCA pump.

[![Figure 1.18 . PCA Pump.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/bin/ch1therapy-Image022.gif)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.18/?report=objectonly "Figure 1.18 ")

Patient-controlled analgesia can be very beneficial for select patients, reducing the time for medication administration and allowing pain medication to reach the patient more rapidly to reduce pain symptoms. This can help prevent out-of-control pain levels that require a significant length of time to resolve. The principles behind the method of patient-controlled analgesia involve the patient’s experience of pain, subsequent administration of a drug via the PCA pump, the drug action within the bloodstream, and the patient response. Depending on the level of pain relief, the patient may experience symptom resolution or may proceed with a dose demand process by activating the PCA pump at a subsequent interval. The patient becomes an active party in medicating themselves to help control the pain experience.

It is critical that patients who are prescribed a PCA pump with demand dosing understand the safety principles behind the medication administration. Patients and their family members must be aware that only the patient is allowed to initiate the demand dose by pressing the medication button to ensure they are alert enough to do so. In this manner, oversedation and life-threatening respiratory depression can be avoided with demand dosing.

Additionally, patients should receive education regarding the frequency with which they will receive a demand dose in order to be reassured that they cannot accidentally overdose themselves by pressing the demand button too frequently. Cues such as an audible “beep” often accompany the demand dose and can help cue the patient that the medication was administered. Conversely, if the demand button has been initiated too closely within the programmed interval, an audible “chirp” may signal to the patient that the demand dose was too soon. The patient should receive instruction that if the chirp has been noted, they may wish to wait a few minutes and reinitiate the demand.

Patients with impaired cognition or restricted upper extremity dexterity may not be appropriate for PCA. If a nurse has concerns regarding the appropriateness of self-administration of pain medication via a PCA pump based on characteristics and clinical condition of an individual patient, the prescribing provider should be notified, and alternate pain control measures should be considered.

The basic principles of a PCA medication order include the following:

**Loading dose**: Ordered amount of medication administered at the time of PCA initiation

**Demand dose**: Medication dose given on activation of demand (pressing the demand button)

**Lockout interval**: Time period in which no follow-up demand dose may be administered (even if demand button is activated)

**Basal infusion**: Continuous rate of medication administration, regardless of demand attempts

**Lockout maximum**: The maximum dose of medication that can be administered within a certain period, commonly prescribed to 1 hour limit

**Breakthrough bolus dose**: A dose of opioid or non-opioid medication administered by the nurse for breakthrough pain.

Medications that are commonly prescribed for PCA administration include opioids such as morphine, hydromorphone, and fentanyl. Nurses must be familiar with specific institutional policies and protocols regarding the use of PCA administration. These protocols commonly include the use of specific provider orders, safety checks, and patient monitoring. Many organizations have transitioned to the use of preprinted PCA order sets to help guarantee that required PCA dosing parameters are appropriately addressed. Within a PCA order, the prescriber must include the following information: identification of the specific medication to be used in the PCA pump, the medication concentration, the specific quantity of the demand dose, the lockout interval, and the order lockout maximum. When a nurse is initiating a PCA pump, it is critical that the order be reviewed and verified with another registered nurse according to agency policy. The double-check verification helps ensure that the pump is programmed correctly, and lockout limits are included to decrease the risk of accidentally self-administering too much medication.\[[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]

Due to the potential adverse effects of opioids administered via a PCA pump, there is a significant risk for patient safety requiring specific monitoring by the nurse. Continuous pulse oximetry, end tidal carbon dioxide monitoring, and frequent vital signs monitoring may be required with initiation and ongoing use of a PCA pump. Individuals with obstructive airway disease, sleep apnea, obesity, renal or hepatic impairment, and recent analgesia, sedation, or anesthesia are at increased risk of complications associated with PCA administration, such as decreased level of consciousness, respiratory distress, and hypotension.\[[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] Dosing parameters must account for patient specific factors and individualized clinical need when initiated by the prescribing provider. Additionally, nurses must be especially vigilant when first initiating PCA infusion because initial infusion is when administration complications may be more frequently observed.

### Please review the “[Adverse Effects of Opioids](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingfundamentals/chapter/11-4-pain-management/)” section in Open RN [Nursing Fundamentals](https://wtcs.pressbooks.pub/nursingfundamentals/) for more information about potential patient side effects.

Nursing staff must also be cognizant of the post-administration assessment and individualized response of each patient to PCA. Even though the patient is actively participating in their pain control plan through self-administration, pain response must be thoroughly documented. Nurses must frequently assess the patient’s number of demands and subsequent doses received. Nurses should also carefully monitor the patient’s vital signs, pain self-report, and nonverbal indications of the pain experience. This focused pain assessment helps ensure that the pain level is adequately controlled.

The use of PCA pumps require vigilant checks by two licensed registered nurses minimally at the start of every shift. The secure PCA pump holds the prescribed opioid medication in a locked device with a demand button that is given to the patient. Keys to the PCA pump are safely stored in secure areas such as within an automated drug dispensing machine. The pumps also have an access code to ensure that tampering with the pump settings does not occur. To document the amount and frequency of pain medication the patient is receiving, as well as to prevent drug diversion, the settings on the pump are checked at the end of every shift as part of the bedside report. The incoming and outgoing nurses double-check and document the pump settings, the amount of medication administered during the previous shift, and the amount of medication left in the syringe. When a PCA is discontinued, nurses must carefully document the remainder of medication left in the PCA syringe and follow organizational policies related to narcotic wasting and documentation.

PCA pumps often have specialized tubing and connections to prevent inadvertent connection of secondary medication to the dedicated PCA line above the pump. If a bolus of medication is administered via a dedicated PCA line below the pump, the nurse must ensure it is compatible with the PCA medication.

### Epidural

**Epidural** medication administration is a type of specialized infusion that is different than intravenous infusion. The use of an epidural involves administering analgesics and anesthetics directly into the spinal fluid via an epidural catheter for severe pain management. It is inserted by specially trained health professionals and requires additional safety measures and nurse monitoring to help prevent patient complications. Safety measures such as specially colored tubing and different Luer lock systems are incorporated to ensure only epidural medications are administered via the epidural line.

Epidurals are typically used with surgical procedures or during labor and delivery. Epidural infusions may also be used to treat chronic pain that has not responded to more conservative treatments. Common anesthetics that are used in epidural infusions include bupivacaine and ropivacaine administered alone or in combination with opioid medications. Anesthetics and analgesics administered via the epidural route work synergistically (i.e., cooperatively) to provide greater pain relief at lower doses.\[[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] See [Figure 1.19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.19/?report=objectonly)\[[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\] for an image of an epidural pump with colored tubing and an image of freshly inserted lumbar epidural catheter. The epidural site has been prepared with tincture of iodine, and the dressing has not yet been applied.

[![Figure 1.19 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/bin/ch1therapy-Image023.gif)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/figure/ch1therapy.F1.19/?report=objectonly "Figure 1.19 ")

Epidural catheters are inserted and may only be repositioned by trained anesthesia professionals. The anesthesia provider will administer a test dose of medication into the epidural to ensure that it is appropriately positioned. Once adequate positioning has been confirmed, the anesthesia provider will record the documented **block height** by assessing the patient’s response to cold at various levels of the thoracic spine. This should be recorded in the patient’s chart and is the subsequent block height for all future neurosensory assessments. Any block level that progresses up the body or is recorded above a level of T4 (fourth thoracic vertebra) must be immediately communicated to the anesthesia provider to prevent respiratory distress and cardiovascular collapse.\[[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]

Once the catheter has been inserted and the position safely confirmed, a prescribing provider will order the medication for epidural infusion. The order must contain the medication name, concentration, and infusion rate. The epidural pump is similar to a PCA pump in that it must be locked and the infusion settings securely programmed. Some epidural pumps allow patients to self-administer on-demand doses. The initiation of the epidural medication may involve setting the pump to infuse at a constant rate or by providing an initial bolus dose and then a constant infusion rate.

Nurses caring for patients receiving epidural medications must monitor patient response to the medication and the epidural insertion site for potential complications associated with epidural infusion. Follow agency policy regarding focused assessments that typically include the patient’s pain management response, vital signs, and motor/sensory checks. Signs of respiratory depression must be carefully monitored and reported to the provider if the patient exhibits a respiratory rate of less than eight breaths/minute, declining oxygen saturation, or decreased level of consciousness. Nurses must also carefully observe the patient’s blood pressure and heart rate with epidural analgesia. Changes in vital signs may be associated with the epidural infusion but can also be the result of post-procedural complications, so vigilant postoperative monitoring must occur. Patients receiving epidural administration are also at risk for bradycardia, so atropine should be readily available in case the patient experiences symptomatic bradycardia.\[[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\],\[[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]

Nurses should be prepared to assess for signs of potential clinical problems associated with epidural usage. [Table 1.7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/table/ch1therapy.T.clinical_problems_and_inter/?report=objectonly) summarizes common clinical problems associated with epidural infusions.

### Table 1.7

Clinical Problems and Interventions With Epidural Infusions\[[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\],\[[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]

| Clinical Problem | Potential Interventions |
| --- | --- |
| Inadequate pain control; partial block | Work with the anesthesia provider to adjust the patient’s position or increase infusion rate. If the block is one-sided, position the patient painful side down to allow gravity to assist the medication to travel down the nerves on the side of pain. |
| Hypotension | Hypotension may occur with epidural use due to the dilation of blood vessels. Notify the provider. The epidural rate may need to be decreased or bolus fluids administered. The patient may require placement in Trendelenberg position. |
| Bradycardia | May occur as the result of blockage of sympathetic nerves. If symptomatic, notify the provider and anticipate possible administration of atropine. |
| Increasing sensation block height/difficulty breathing | The patient may first report signs of tingling in fingers, especially the fifth digits. Notify the provider, turn off infusion, elevate the patient’s head, and administer oxygen. |
| Motor blockage | Leg weakness may occur as a result of an epidural block to the low motor nerves. A reduction in rate may be needed if significant paralysis is experienced. Be cautious of mobility implications associated with reduced sensation. |
| Respiratory depression | If a patient experiences respiratory depression of less than eight breaths per minute, stop the infusion and notify the provider. If indicated, request emergency assistance and administer rescue breaths via a bag-valve-mask. |
| Catheter disconnection | Disconnection of the epidural line presents an increased infection risk. Immediately contact the anesthesia provider, but do NOT reconnect the line. The end of the line may be covered with sterile gauze, according to agency policy, until the anesthesia provider arrives. |
| Catheter migration | Migration of the epidural catheter into a blood vessel may result in exacerbated respiratory depression and sedation. Monitor the patient for any report of tingling around the mouth, numbness, twitching, convulsion, or cardiac arrest. Immediately stop the epidural infusion and provide emergency assistance and cardiopulmonary support. |

Common side effects of epidural medication infusion include nausea and itching associated with the specific medications included in the infusions. Many times, these side effects can be adequately managed with medications, and the epidural infusion may continue. Another common side effect is urinary retention. Nurses should monitor urine output for patients who do not have a urinary catheter in place. Intermittent or indwelling catheterization may be required to drain the bladder and prevent discomfort.\[[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\],\[[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594499/#)\]

### Exercises

(Answers to the exercises are located in the Answer Key at the back of the book).

**Case Study #1**

Eli, age 4, arrives at Urgent Care with his grandmother; he is staying with his grandparents while his parents are on vacation. Eli was playing in the woods behind his grandparents’ home today while his grandpa was clearing brush and returned to the house with a raised, red rash on the left side of his face and arms and hands bilaterally. “I am really itchy,” Eli says, “And my face and arms really hurt.” His grandmother states that they have seen poison ivy in the woods in the past, and Eli’s grandpa didn’t warn him before they went out today. You notice as you observe Eli that he is itching his arms, and his left eye appears swollen.

The MD gives you the following orders:

-   Start a peripheral IV STAT
    
-   Administer diphenhydramine 25 mg IV now and q8h prn for rash

What should you consider when initiating an IV for Eli?

## I. GLOSSARY

Air embolism

The presence of air in the vascular system that occurs when air is introduced into the venous system and travels to the right ventricle and/or pulmonary circulation.

Arterial blood sampling

Blood is obtained via venipuncture into an artery.

Basal infusion

Continuous rate of medication administration, regardless of demand attempts.

Blown vein

A ruptured vein that is leaking blood.

Breakthrough bolus dose

A dose of opioid or non-opioid medication administered by the nurse for breakthrough pain when a patient is receiving patient-controlled analgesia.

Capillary blood testing

A blood sample collected from the capillary blood vessels (i.e., tiny blood vessels located near the surface of the skin).

Catheter embolism

An embolism that occurs when a small part of the cannula breaks off and flows into the vascular system.

An infection caused by microorganisms introduced into the bloodstream through the puncture site, the hub, or contaminated IV tubing or IV solution, leading to bacteremia or sepsis. A CR-BSI is a hospital-acquired preventable infection and considered an adverse event.

Central venous access device (CVAD)

A type of vascular access that involves the insertion of a tube into a vein in the neck, chest, or groin and threaded into a central vein (most commonly the internal jugular, subclavian, or femoral) and advanced until the terminal lumen resides within the inferior vena cava, superior vena cava, or right atrium.

Demand dose

Medication dose given on activation of demand (pressing the demand button).

Epidural

Administration of analgesics and anesthetics into the spinal fluid via an epidural catheter for severe pain management associated with surgical procedures or during labor and delivery.

A condition that occurs when vesicant solution (medication) is administered and inadvertently leaks into surrounding tissue, causing damage to surrounding tissue. It is characterized by the same signs and symptoms as infiltration but also includes burning, stinging, redness, blistering, or necrosis of the tissue.

Hypertonic solutions

IV fluids with a higher concentration of dissolved particles than blood.

Hypotonic solutions

IV fluids with a lower concentration of dissolved solutes than blood.

Infiltration

A condition that occurs when a nonvesicant solution (IV solution) is inadvertently administered into surrounding tissue. Signs and symptoms include pain, swelling, redness, the skin surrounding the insertion site is cool to touch, there is a change in the quality or flow of IV, the skin is tight around the IV site, IV fluid is leaking from IV site, or there are frequent alarms on the IV pump.

Intravenous therapy (IV therapy)

Administration of a substance directly into a person’s vein.

Isotonic solutions

IV fluids with a similar concentration of dissolved particles as blood.

Loading dose

Ordered amount of medication administered at the time of PCA initiation.

Lockout interval

Time period in which no follow-up demand dose may be administered (even if demand button is activated).

Lockout maximum

The maximum dose of medication that can be administered within a certain period, commonly prescribed to 1 hour limit.

Midline peripheral catheters

Larger peripheral catheters (i.e., 16-18 gauge) that allow for rapid infusions and blood sampling and can be used for longer duration that traditional peripheral catheters. They are ultrasound-guided and can be inserted by RNs with additional training or other trained professionals.

Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)

A method of pain management that allows hospitalized patients with severe pain to safely self-administer opioid medications using a programmed pump according to their level of discomfort.

Peripheral IV (PIV)

A short intravenous catheter inserted by percutaneous venipuncture into a peripheral vein and held in place with a sterile transparent dressing.

Phlebitis

The inflammation of the vein’s inner lining, the tunica intima. Clinical indications are localized redness, pain, heat, and swelling that can track up the vein leading to a palpable venous cord.

Pulmonary edema

A condition caused by excess fluid accumulation in the lungs due to excessive fluid in the circulatory system. It is characterized by decreased oxygen saturation; increased respiratory rate; fine or coarse crackles in the lung bases; restlessness; breathlessness; dyspnea; and coughing up pink, frothy sputum. Pulmonary edema requires prompt medical attention and treatment.

Saline locks

A short extension set that allows intermittent IV access without ongoing infusion.

Venipuncture

The process of introducing a needle into a patient’s vein to collect a blood sample or insert an IV catheter.
